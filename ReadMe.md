Welcome to Nathan's Github page. Most of my work is housed in private repositories, either here or on Bitbucket. The only public repositories here are simple examples of code used for teaching or tutoring sessions. Don't worry -- this will change very soon, particularly as the HACK project ([paper](https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=CEF2015&paper_id=523) presented at CEF 2015) is released. Much of my research is written to be compatible with that framework.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to send me a message.
